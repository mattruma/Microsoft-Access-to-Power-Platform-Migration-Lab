# Create a plan

## Process

### Assess current usage

- Inventory all Access databases and their dependencies
- Identify all forms, reports, macros, and modules used in Access
- Identify all data sources used by Access
- Identify all users and their Access privileges
- Determine the overall scope and complexity of the Access solution

### Determine requirement

- Identify the business requirements for the new Power Platform solution
- Identify the desired functionalities from Access that need to be preserved
- Identify any new functionalities that are required in Power Platform
- Identify any performance or scalability requirements for the Power Platform solution
- Identify any data security and compliance requirements

### Select target platform

- Choose the Power Platform solution (e.g. Dataverse, Power Apps, Power Automate) that best meets your requirements
- Determine the best approach for migrating data to the selected platform (e.g. manual data entry, automated data migration)

### Prepare data

- Clean and format data from Access databases for migration to Power Platform
- Verify data accuracy and completeness
- Determine the best approach for storing data in Power Platform (e.g. Dataverse tables, Excel)
- Export tables to Excel
- Use data flows to import the data into the Power Platform

### Develop solution

- Create a Power Apps solution to replace Access forms
- Create a Power Automate solution to automate tasks and workflows
- Create Dataverse tables to store data
- Integrate Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dataverse as needed
- Customize the Power Platform solution to meet your requirements

### Test and validate

- Test the new Power Platform solution to ensure it meets your requirements and performs as expected
- Validate the accuracy and completeness of migrated data
- Ensure that the Power Platform solution is compatible with other systems and services

### Deploy and train

- Deploy the new Power Platform solution to production
- Provide training to end users on how to use the new solution
- Ensure that users understand how to access and update data in Power Platform

### Support and maintenance

- Establish a support and maintenance plan to ensure ongoing stability and performance of the Power Platform solution
- Monitor usage and performance of the solution
- Update the solution as needed to meet changing requirements
- Provide ongoing training to end users to ensure they are using the solution effectively
